# Agent Based Modelling for Macroeconomics
I'm sure it's been done plenty of times before. Worth looking up.

Initially replicate a new Keynesian 3-Equation model in an agent-based framework.

# Three Equation NK Model via simulation

1. Model Design & Theory
    - Determine the type of agents to include
    - For each agent, define the set of decisions to be taken, internal states, structure of decision rules, information exchange, transitions of internal states, empirical & theoretical & experimental grounding.
    - Interaction protocols for agents and methods
2. Codification
    - Define the rules into code
    - Properly test the code
3. Parameter choice & Calibration
    - Define, estimate, and calibrate the parameters
    - Analyse emergent properties
4. Model analysis
    - Study the effects of changes in model parameters (e.g. policy parameters)
    - Study the effects of changes in model structure
    - etc.
